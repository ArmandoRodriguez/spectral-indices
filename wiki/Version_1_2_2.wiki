    # Modified the application to write out all the vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) to the same output file, containing multiple bands.  As with previous releases, only the user-specified indices will be written.  And, the other indices (NBR, NBR2, NDMI) are still written to their own output file as single bands.
